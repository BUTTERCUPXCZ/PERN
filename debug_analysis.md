# Deployment Bug Analysis

## Problem
The deployment fails with error: `Cannot find package '@vitejs/plugin-react'` during the Vite build process.

## Analysis Results

### 1. Package Configuration ✅
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` is correctly listed in `frontend/package.json` devDependencies (line 28)
- Version: `^4.6.0`
- Vite configuration correctly imports and uses the plugin

### 2. Build Process Analysis ❌
The issue is in the build command sequence:

**Current build command (from root package.json line 8):**
```
"build": "npm install && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend"
```

**Problem identified:**
The build process installs devDependencies in the frontend directory, but deployment environments often skip devDependencies in production builds. Since `@vitejs/plugin-react` is in devDependencies, it may not be available during the build process on Render.

### 3. Root Cause
The `@vitejs/plugin-react` package is classified as a devDependency, but it's actually required during the build process. In deployment environments, devDependencies are often excluded to reduce bundle size and installation time.

## Recommended Fix
Move `@vitejs/plugin-react` from devDependencies to dependencies in `frontend/package.json` since it's required for the build process.
